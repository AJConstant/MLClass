# Projects

All projects, your own or suggested ones here, have the same due date: Dec 7. 
Early turn-in by Thanksgiving, Nov. 26 will give you 10% bonus on the project part.

The two project ideas are: 
1. [MiniNN](./MiniNN.md), a collection of independent tasks on the MiniNN library. 
2. [Organic Chemistry](./organic_chemistry.md), a project of modeling the metabolism of a bacterium.
