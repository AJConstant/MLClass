# Why Machine Learning (ML)

- How computers know how to do things?
- Two ways:
    1. programming: steps detailed by human programmer
    2. learning: without being specifically told 
- Example 1: machine translation
    1. programming: writing many rules to replace and reposition words, e.g., 
    _Do you speak Julia?_ _Sprechen Sie Julia?_   
    2. learning: feeding the computer many bilingual documents 
- Example 2: sorting 
    1. programming: Quicksort, etc. 
    2. learning: feeding the computer many pairs of unsorted and sorted list of numbers. 
- The first approach in the context of AI is also called rule-based system or expert system, e.g. MyCin, Grammarly. 

# Why ML is attractive

- We are lazy. We want to shift the heavy lifting to the computers. 
- We are incompetent. No kidding! Sometimes it is very difficult to come up with step-by-step instructions. Examples: 
    0. Self-driving
    1. AlphaGo 
    2. Automated circuit routing
    3. Machine translation
    4. Commonsense reasoning, text entailment 
    5. Document generation, auto-reply of messages/emails
    6. Next word predition
